Im not sure which city I want to live in except Chengdu, the major three city of china: Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, have their own advantages. Shenzhen has the best Air quality, even a bad  winter day in Shenzhen is still better than a usual day in Beijing or Shanghai. Besides  Shenzhen is so close to Hong Kong, though  Hong Kong is more and more boring these years, its still a plus to me.
Shanghai, Shanghai is some kind of “Shanghaiism”, its beauty, its modernization, its capitalism, its the most international city of China, but its “Shanghaiism”, looking for a job, Shanghai maybe a good choice for me, but not for live in. Beijing, compared to Shanghai, its less Western, otherwise its pretty good, but the pros is less Western, means work and live in Beijing I will get lots of Chinese Wisdom in my career. So if there is a same job for me in three of these city, I will choose Shenzhen, good air, has clean bays, warm-hearted and kind people (with out xenophobia, cause in Shenzhen everyone is an out of towner). But life must go on, job is the top priority, maybe one day I will leave Chengdu, for a job or a love, but should not for seek some place to live in.
