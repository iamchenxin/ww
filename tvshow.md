House of Cards.
Though i don't like the real life politics which is driven by power and money. HoC is dramatized, made for tv and entertainment, so there's nothing predictable about the story, and the story is compelling and unfolds at a great pace. Not too fast, not too slow. It is not ridden with unreasonable twists and turns,  and every episode provides a new twist while foreshadowing something else, its perfect, Uh-huh? It also this TV show have some surrealistic, like a Democrat suggest ending Social Security and Medicare. But things could  not happen in real life is indeed a real wonderful part of a drama.
An other and biggest reason is character, Kevin Spacey, maybe this drama is a bit too centered around Kevin Spacey, as if the whole world rises and falls by his hand, But he is really fun to watch, some kind of Spacey's narrative, directly address us within the scene rather than give a disembodied voiceover to scenes he's already in. Frank Underwood might be one of his best roles of all time. He has great chemistry with all the characters on the show, particularly Robin Wright. The Macbeth/ Lady Macbeth allusions are very stark and seeing how their relationship ebbs and flows is a great backdrop to the overarching storyline.
